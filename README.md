This project is an example to showcase my knowledge in R programming language and demonstrating the step by step process of the data cleaning, data manipulation, analysis and conclusion (or so-called Exploratory Data Analysis for Data Science). It was created using rstudio and was submitted to our "Computational Data Analysis" class in the university. This project demonstrates my skills in data mining with visualizations in R. I also have performed GIS (geographic information) visualizations in the analysis.
